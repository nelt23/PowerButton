# PowerButton


In 2020, I embraced the challenge of mastering SwiftUI within a 100-day timeframe. This repository has one of the many projects that I create. The inspiration for the animation within this particular project was drawn from https://dribbble.com/shots/9514299-Power-Button. Using SwiftUI, I recreated the visually striking button animation showcased on the aforementioned link.
